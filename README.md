# Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the basics of image classification using TensorFlow and the Keras API. The notebook `Basic_ImageClassification_with_TensorFlow.ipynb` walks through the process of building a neural network to classify images from the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits.

## Features
- Utilizes TensorFlow 2 and Keras API.
- Implements a sequential model with multiple Dense layers.
- Employs image normalization and one-hot encoding for labels.
- Evaluates model accuracy and loss on the test dataset.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following packages:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
